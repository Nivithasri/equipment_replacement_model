# Equipment Replacement Model

## About the Project
The **Equipment Replacement Model** is designed to help companies determine the optimal time to replace old machines to maximize profits. This project uses dynamic programming to break down the machine replacement problem into smaller, manageable subproblems and find the best solution at each stage. An interactive interface allows users to input machine data and receive insights into whether to keep or replace the machine for maximum profit over a planning horizon.

## Key Features
1. **Decision Optimization**:
  -Determines the best time to replace machines to maximize net income over multiple years.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
  -Efficiently solves the replacement problem by using recursive calculations to find the optimal decisions.

3. **Interactive Interface**:
  -Users can input machine-specific data, including yearly revenues, operating costs, salvage values, and replacement costs.

4. **Comprehensive Output**:
  -Displays the optimal decision (keep or replace) at each stage.
  -Calculates and displays the maximum total cost over the given planning horizon.

6. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  -Intuitive design to enhance user experience in entering data and interpreting results.

## Mathematical Model

### Problem Statement:
-At the start of each year over a planning horizon of n years, a decision must be made:
  -Keep the machine for another year.
  -Replace the machine with a new one.
### Variables:
r(t): Yearly revenue generated by a machine t years old.
c(t): Operating cost of a machine t years old.
s(t): Salvage value obtained by selling a machine t years old.
I: Cost of acquiring a new machine.
### Recursive Objective Function:
To maximize net income:
-If the machine is kept:
r(t) - c(t) + fi+1(t+1)
-If the machine is replaced:
r(0) + s(t) - I - c(0) + fi+1(1)
Where fi+1(t+1) represents the maximum net income for the remaining years with the machine aging by one year.

## Software Requirements
